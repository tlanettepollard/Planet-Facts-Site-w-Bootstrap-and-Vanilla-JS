		Venus

		<!-- Overview Content Start -->

		Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess
		of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky
		after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions,
		visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Source : Wikipedia

		<!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

		The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they
		share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of
		Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the
		two planets have been cooling at about the same rate. Source : Wikipedia

		<!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

		Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic
		activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167
		large volcanoes that are over 100 km (60 mi) across. The only volcanic
		complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii. Source :
