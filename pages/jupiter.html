  Jupiter

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

  Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
  It is a gas giant with a mass two and a half times that of all the other 
  planets in the Solar System combined, but less than one-thousandth the mass 
  of the Sun.

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

  When the Juno arrived in 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very diffuse core 
  that mixes into its mantle. A possible cause is an impact from a planet of 
  about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which 
  would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.

  The best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a persistent 
  anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator. It is known to have 
  existed since at least 1831, and possibly since 1665.
